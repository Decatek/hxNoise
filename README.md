# hxNoise
A collection of noise functions for Haxe. Has no dependencies to other libraries. 

##Diamond Square
### Usage
The samples/luxe/DiamondSquare folder contains sample of how the algorithm can be used together with the game engine Luxe. The use sample is easily applied to your game engine of choice however. The only part that is Luxe specific in the sample is the rendering of tha float values that the algorithm generates.
### Credits
This implementation is based on another implementation presented here:

##Work in progress
This library is currently a work in progress. Currently only contains Diamond Square noise.
